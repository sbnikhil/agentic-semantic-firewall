# Agentic Semantic Firewall 

Agentic Semantic Firewall is a project I’m developing to explore how we can make LLMs safer to use in a professional setting. It’s essentially a middle layer or a security gateway, designed to help with the "Shadow AI" issue, which is when employees use AI tools in ways the company can’t see or secure.

## Why I’m building this
I noticed that many companies are stuck between wanting to use AI and being afraid of data leaks. When people use personal AI accounts for work, sensitive information can accidentally be sent to external models.

I wanted to see if I could build a system that lets people stay productive with AI while adding a layer of protection for the company’s data.

### More details and implementation coming soon !
